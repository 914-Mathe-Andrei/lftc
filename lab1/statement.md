Statement: Considering a small programming language (that we shall call mini-language), write 3 small programs in this language.

Deliverables: p1.*, p2.* and p3.* and p1err.* - small programs written in your programming language (p1, p2, p3 should be lexically correct; p1err should contain 2 types of lexical errors).

For example:
- p1 and p2: compute min/max of 3 numbers; verify if a number is prime, compute gcd of 2 numbers, compute the solutions for a 2nd order equation
- p3: compute the sum of n numbers, compute the min/max of n numbers
