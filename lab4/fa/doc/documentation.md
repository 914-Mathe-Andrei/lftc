## I. Introduction

     The entire implementation is written in python v3.11.

     The program consists of a menu driven interface from where the user can interact with the finite automaton, by displayed the alphabet / states / transitions of the FA and by verify if a sequence is accepted. The FA is implemented as class named **************FiniteAutomata************** that receives a file that describes it. The input file is written in TOML with a fixed structure.

## II. Details

### main.py

     The module represents the entry of the program and defines the menu and initializes the FA.

### fa.py

     The module contains the ********FiniteAutomata******** class and within the class there is a *****State***** structure representing a FA state that has a name and a list of transitions. A transitions is a key-value pair where the key is the symbol that the state can consume and the value is the next state.

### State

The class contains the name of the state and a dictionary of transitions. A transition is a key-value pair where the key is the symbol that the state is able to consume and the value is the next state if that symbol is going to be consumed.

### FiniteAutomata

The class contains the alphabet as a list of symbols (strings), the states as a dictionary, where the key is the name of the state and the value the corresponding ******State****** instance, the initial state as a *****State***** instance and, finally, the final states as a list of *****State***** instances. The constructor of the class requires as parameter a file where the FA is described in order to load its elements. The user can check if a sequence is accepted by the FA by calling the ********check_acceptance()******** class method that receives a sequence (actually a string) and return ****True**** if it is accepted, otherwise *****False*****.

## III. FA input file

     The FA input file is written in [TOML](https://toml.io/en/) and has a fixed structure. Here the FAâ€™s alphabet, states, inital / final states and transitions are described.
